                <p>Our meetings are arranged in such a way that allows everyone to function by speaking, testifying or prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is according to the New Testament practice of each one sharing something of their experience of Christ in the meetings in order to edify the other members.</p>

                    <p>We attempt to practice the church life as seen in the Bible. We remember the Lord each week at His Table by sharing the elements of the unleavened bread and fruit of the vine in a corporate way as we mutually enjoy the Lord’s presence through our singing, praying and speaking. Without testing or judgement we receive all that the Lord has received according to Romans 15:6-7. Those whom the Lord has received we recognize as fellow members of the Body of Christ, making no distinctions or divisions among members.</p>

                    <p>We call ourselves the church in Madison according to the practice and revelation of the New Testament. We are not the only church but we are only the church. We cannot call ourselves something we are not; therefore, we can take no other name than that of the Lord Jesus and simply meet as the church in the city where we live. We view all the believers in Madison as being part of the same church. Therefore, we endeavor to practice the oneness as revealed in the New Testament by meeting as the church in Madison.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Bible is the complete divine revelation inspired word by word by God through the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21, 2 Tim. 3:16)</li>
                        <li>God is uniquely one, yet triune - the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (1 Tim. 2:5a, Matt. 28:19)</li>
                        <li>The Son of God, even God Himself, was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus Christ (John 1:1, John 1:14)</li>
                        <li>Christ died on the cross for our sins, shedding His blood for our redemption (1 Pet. 2:24, Eph. 1:7a)</li>
                        <li>Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day (1 Cor. 15:4)</li>
                        <li>Christ ascended to the right hand of God to be Lord of all (Acts 1:9, Acts 2:33, Acts 2:36)</li>
                        <li>Whenever any person repents to God and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he is regenerated (born again) and becomes a living member of the one Body of Christ (Acts 20:21, John 3:3, Eph. 1:22-23, Rom. 12:5)</li>
                        <li>Christ is coming again to receive His believers to Himself (1 Thes. 2:19)</li>
